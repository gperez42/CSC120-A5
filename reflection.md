- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
The concept of associations is a little bit confusing for me, but it also allowed me to look at the code in a different way and try to interpret how everything was connected. I tried to view the associations as different puzzle pieces represented by the classes that needed other puzzle pieces, or other classes, to make the full puzzle. This didn't always work with different associations, but it helped me simplify the idea in my brain when I didn't quite understand the associations between every class. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Consulting with peers definitely helped me feel less alone in my struggles and find new ways to code and solve the problems I was having. Additionally, I think that working on the assignments with help from TAs and in environments with other people helped me feel more motivated and less overwhelmed with assignments. To someone taking this course in the future, definitely go to TA hours and office hours if you can because that has been the most helpful for me to be able to complete the assignments and meet people/work on your assignments in a supportive environment.
